intput
an int and we are trying to find the divisors



function




output
12 = 2, 3, 4, 6


1. //function statemetn named divisor with parameter integer

2. //place holder empty array anmed res

3. //for loop variable i assigned to 2 as initiator
// i is less or equal to integer condition
//i plus plus after every loop

4. //if statemetn integer mudulus i is equal to zero

5. //res.push i 
//this bushes every i index that is divisable

6. //return res.length which checks that the length is at least one
//turnary operator res if truthy integer if falsy plus ' is prime'
