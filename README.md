### first function two to one

Description:
Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from ato z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

Examples:
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

### second function sum of odd numbers

iption:
Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.:

rowSumOddNumbers(1); // 1
rowSumOddNumbers(2); // 3 + 5 = 8

### third function regex validate pin

Description:
ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

Examples
"1234"   -->  true
"12345"  -->  false
"a234"   -->  false

### fourth function printererror


Description:
In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

Examples:
s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
error_printer(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
error_printer(s) => "8/22"

## fifth function find next square 


Description:
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

Examples:

findNextSquare(121) --> returns 144
findNextSquare(625) --> returns 676
findNextSquare(114) --> returns -1 since 114 is not a perfect square

## sixth function named categorize


Description:
The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

Input
Input will consist of a list of lists containing two items each. Each list contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

Note for F#: The input will be of (int list list) which is a List<List>

Example Input
[[18, 20],[45, 2],[61, 12],[37, 6],[21, 21],[78, 9]]
Output
Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

Example Output
["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

### seventh function ones and zeros

Description:
Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

Examples:

Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.

### eighth function named friend or foe


Description:
Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

i.e.

friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]
Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.

### NINTH FUNCTION binary addition

Description:
Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

Examples:

add_binary(1, 1) == "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
add_binary(5, 9) == "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)

## TENTH FUNCTION IS THIS A TRIANGLE

Description:
Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The method should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).

## eleventh function people on bus
escription:
Number of people in the bus
There is a bus moving in the city, and it takes and drop some people in each bus stop.

You are provided with a list (or array) of integer arrays (or tuples). Each integer array has two items which represent number of people get into bus (The first item) and number of people get off the bus (The second item) in a bus stop.

Your task is to return number of people who are still in the bus after the last bus station (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus is not empty and some people are still in the bus, and they are probably sleeping there :D

Take a look on the test cases.

Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the return integer can't be negative.

The second value in the first integer array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

## twelveth function named find the diviros


1.Description:
Create a function named divisors/Divisors that takes an integer n > 1 and returns an array with all of the integer's divisors(except for 1 and the number itself), from smallest to largest. If the number is prime return the string '(integer) is prime' (null in C#) (use Either String a in Haskell and Result<Vec<u32>, String> in Rust).

Example:
divisors(12); // should return [2,3,4,6]
divisors(25); // should return [5]
divisors(13); // should return "13 is prime"

## eleventh function named Sum of the first nth term of Series

Description:
Task:
Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
Rules:
You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00

You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

Examples:
SeriesSum(1) => 1 = "1.00"
SeriesSum(2) => 1 + 1/4 = "1.25"
SeriesSum(5) => 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 = "1.57"
NOTE: In PHP the function is called series_sum().

### thirteenth function Remove the minimum

Description:
The museum of incredible dull things
The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

Task
Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

Examples
removeSmallest([1,2,3,4,5]) = [2,3,4,5]
removeSmallest([5,3,2,1,4]) = [5,3,2,4]
removeSmallest([2,2,1,2,1]) = [2,2,2,1]
